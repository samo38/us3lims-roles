# Ansible US3LIMS deployment 

This repository is a collection of ansible roles that are used to deploy and keep a us3 lims server up to date. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/KJSain/us3lims-roles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/KJSain/us3lims-roles)

current roles travis/molecule tested: 
- config-lims-php
- config-lims-lims
- config-lims-slurm
- config-lims-us3-user
- config-lims-database

Builds are currently all on Centos8

**This is still in the Work In Progress stage.** 

## Current State 
Currently, we still have more testing and fixes to deal with. Particularly related with getting SSL configured to work with US3 for mysql encrypted mysql connections. This has only been tested on CentOS 8 thus far. 

### TODO 

Moved to wiki/issues/project..

## Summary of 'what does it do?' thus far

Please review the wiki 

## Getting Started

How to get it setup and working. 

### Prerequisites

If not already installed, [install ansible.]( https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html )

### Get other requirements 

There are a couple of ansible roles used developed by [geerlingguy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy) that we use. 

Run ansible-galaxy on the requirements.yml file to obtain the roles. 

```
ansible-galaxy -r requirements.yml
```

## Using it

Modifying the example-playbook.yml is a good starting ground. 

### Some required variable definitons: 

`us3_db_pass` - database password for newus3 user

`root_db_pass` - database password for root mysql user 

`gbl_db_pass` - database password for global (gfac) user 
 
`us3php_db_pass` - database password for us3php user 

`limsadmin_db_pass` - database password for limsadmin 

`admin_email` - Email of Admin that will be primarily responsible for the LIMS server 

`admins_db_pass` - Initial DB password for all admins - Defaults are for Alexey, Borries and Gary

`ipaddr_ext` - External/Public facing IP address of the LIMS server 

`ipaddr_int` - The internal IP address of the host


### Running it: 
```
ansible-playbook foobar-lims.yml
```

#### Encrypting the playbooks 

Since using passwords are neccessary, I would recommend either encrypting the password strings or encrypting the entire playbook. The best way to handle this is likely using [ansible vault.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) I will provide the main example below: 

To do the encryption: 
```
ansible-vault encrypt foobar-lims.yml
```
You'll be prompted for a new Vault password. Standard practices apply for this password. 

Once encryption is done the file will look something like this now: 
```
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
35393464386239313434646663656134633933336263336165663063326564376539336431393938
656666323666636432366536656661663...
```

To run the playbook now you can use `--ask-vault` to be prompted for a password. You can view their docs on this for other options. 
```
ansible-playbook foobar-lims.yml --ask-vault
``` 

Oh no! How will you edit this now? 

You can run: 
```
ansible-vault edit foobar-lims.yml
```
This will open the file in plain text in your default editor. 

Alternatively, you can encrypt and decrypt it every time with:
```
ansible-vault decrypt foobar-lims.yml 
```
The last tid bit is you can change the 'Vault Password' by using 
```
ansible-vault rekey foobar-lims.yml
````

An example file was uploaded in the repository with the vault password of `test` :)
